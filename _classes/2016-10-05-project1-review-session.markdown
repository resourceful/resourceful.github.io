If you had difficulties understanding what we did in the class, please visit _Fusion Tech Center #804_ any time on this Friday (2016-10-07). Class assistant will help you understanding kernel compile, module compile, making the file system, and using ctags.

If you don't have time to review session, then please send a mail (nyg0813_at_gmail_dot_com) explaining where you got stuck.
