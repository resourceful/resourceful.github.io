## Children Learn What They Live ##

*Dorothy Law Nolte, Ph D.*

If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.<br>
If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.<br>
If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.<br>
If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.<br>
If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.<br>
If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.<br>
If children live with praise, they learn appreciation.<br>
If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.<br>
